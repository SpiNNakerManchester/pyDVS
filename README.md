## A Cython-based Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) emulator. It can be used within a Python environment as demostrated in the various test files.


A DVS is a camera-like sensor 

Requirements:
- Cython
- Numpy
- OpenCV (with Python bindings)

Files:
- `pydvs/`:
  - `generate_spikes.pyx`  - Cython backend library. Contains functions to generate spikes from a video feed.
  - `external_dvs_emulator_device*.py` - sPyNNaker class wrapper, it's compatible with OpenCV VideoCapture devices and VirtualCam.
  - `virtual_cam.py` - A camera emulator that feeds on images located in the users computer. It keeps images moving based on eye movements (e.g. micro saccades and saccades); there's a very simple attention model for the saccade mode. 

- `spynnaker_test.py` - Demonstration script for sPyNNaker compatible frontend.
- `stand_alone*.py` - Demonstration scripts for the Cython backend, they come in single- and multi-threaded versions.
- `virtual_cam_test.py` - Demonstration script for the VirtualCam class, it requires images in a directory ("./mnist" by default)
